## I'm Back!

As opposed to my initial plan of regularly updating this so called blog, I'm more inclined towards just posting occasional updates about whatever I feel like, thanks to the resounding failure of doing it more often ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Anyway, I had a really interesting semester. I was super excited for it to begin so that I could study core electronics. It was my perception that it was what I would be able to ace since I had keen interest in the field. The problem started when I realized that I did'nt really know what <i>core electronics</i> really meant... 

Consequently, I messed up the first half of the semester; did'nt study most of the subjects and wasted most of my time doing what I don't know... As a result, My Mid-Semester exams were a disaster. I scored well in Digital Design, since that was the only subject I was good at, and to my surprise, in Electronic Devices. I remeber finishing 2 courses on Coursera in 5 hours during the night before the ED Mid-Sem exam and that is probably why I got most of the theoretical question correct. All the other subjects were a total disaster.

The Mid-Sem fiasco made me realize how serious the situation was. That was definitely the turning point. 
I changed almost everything. Attended all the classes and everything. By the semester end, I was partly confident on some of my weakest subjects. My Comprehensive exams went really well in most of the subjects but the damage cause by the Mid-Sem was too much and I could'nt go much above the average grades. 

Despite it all, I learned a lot. I now, hopefully, know how to actually deal with the courses in college and will no doubt give in my best. <i>Next Sem Phodenge!</i>
